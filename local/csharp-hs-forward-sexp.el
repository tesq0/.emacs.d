(defun csharp-hs-forward-sexp (&optional arg)

  "I set hs-forward-sexp-func to this function.

I found this customization necessary to do the hide/show magic in C#
code, when dealing with region/endregion. This routine
goes forward one s-expression, whether it is defined by curly braces
or region/endregion. It handles nesting, too.

The forward-sexp method takes an arg which can be negative, which
indicates the move should be backward.  Therefore, to be fully
correct this function should also handle a negative arg. However,
the hideshow.el package never uses negative args to its
hs-forward-sexp-func, so it doesn't matter that this function does not
do negative numbers.

The arg can also be greater than 1, which means go forward
multiple times. This function doesn't handle that EITHER.  But
again, I haven't see that as a problem."
